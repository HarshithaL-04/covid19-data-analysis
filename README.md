# covid19-data-analysis
Python practice project analyzing COVID-19 dataset with Pandas and Seaborn/Matplotlib
Covers data cleaning, exploration, aggregation, and visualization techniques.
This project was created as a practice project to strengthen my Python, Pandas, and data analysis skills.**
It includes:
- Data exploration (`df.head()`, `df.tail()`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()`)
- Handling missing values (`isnull()`, `fillna()`)
- Aggregation (`groupby()`, `total deaths / total cases`)
- Visualizations (`displot`, `jointplot`, `pairplot`, `catplot`)
